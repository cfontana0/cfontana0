Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience in startups worldwide. As a technical lead, I excel at coordinating the development of new products and services, validating them in the market, and fostering innovation.

I am particularly interested in projects related to alternative social networks, blockchain, and digital identity, as I am driven by the goal of enhancing privacy, eliminating intermediaries, and empowering individuals. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about exploring AI projects, recognizing their potential while acknowledging the responsibility that comes with their development.
