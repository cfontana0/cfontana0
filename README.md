So, you might find me with my nose in a book or two, but I'm always ready to chat.<br><br>Feel free to pick my brain about LATAM & UK opportunities or if you're curious about the digital nomad life. I've got stories and advice to spare!<br><br>And hey, here's a fun little nugget about me: I've been a globe-trotter and workaholic rolled into one for over 2 years!
